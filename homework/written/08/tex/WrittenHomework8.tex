\begin{questions}
    \question Using $\B,\C$ as defined below, answer the following questions
    \[
        \B = \setBasic{t^2, 1+t, 1-t}, \C = \setBasic{1+t+t^2, 1, t^2}
    \]
    \begin{parts}
        \part[10] Demonstrate that $\B$ and $\C$ are each a basis for $\mathcal{P}_2(\R)$ (The set of all polynomials with
        real coefficients of degree at most $2$).
        \part[10] Write the change of basis matrix given by $\underset{\C\leftarrow\B}{P}$.
