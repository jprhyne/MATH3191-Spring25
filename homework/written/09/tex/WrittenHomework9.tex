\begin{questions}
    \question Let $A,B\in\R^{2\times 2}$ be defined as below and use theme to answer both of the following
    $A$ is similar to $B$
    \[
        A = \bMat{
            1 & 2\\
            3 & k
        }, B = \bMat{
            4 & 0 \\
            0 & -1
        }
    \]
    \begin{parts}
        \part[10] Determine a value for $k$ such that $A$ is similar to $B$.
        \part[10] Compute a matrix $C$ such that $AC = CB$ and $C$ is invertible.
