\begin{questions}
    \question[10] Let $A\in\R^{2\times 2}$ be defined as below. 
    Give an explicit formula for it's eigenvalues in terms of it's elements. (\emph{Hint}: You don't
    have to form $A-\lambda I$ to answer this question, but you can if you want to)
    \[
        A = \bMat{
            a & b\\
            c & d
        }
    \]
    \newpage
    \question[10] Give an example of two matrices that are row equivalent, but have different eigenvalues.
    (\emph{Note}: You can use a $2\times 2$ to answer this question)
