\begin{questions}
    \question[10] Let 
    \[
        A = \begin{bmatrix}
            a & b & c\\
            1 & 2 & 3\\
            3 & 2 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    Compute the determinant of $A$ as a function of $a,b,c$. Note: This means you should have
    $a,b,c$ present in your answer.
    \newpage
    \question[10] Let $A$ be an invertible matrix such that $A^{-1} = A^\top$. What are the possible
    values for the determinant of $A$? Explain how you got your answer.
