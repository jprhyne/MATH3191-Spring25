# Purpose
This directory holds the style files that I use to compile the tex files. In order to compile, either add this directory to your latex compiler's search path or in the standard one.

The standard placement for a single user for a style file named `filename.sty` on \*Nix operating systems 
(MacOS, Linux-based, etc) is
```$(HOME)/texmf/tex/latex/filename/filename.sty```
